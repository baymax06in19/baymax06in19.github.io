# Hey, nice to see you! 👋

I'm **Tharaka K**, a recent graduate from the University of Moratuwa working as an AI Engineer.

This page is dedicated to open-source learning focused on *learning to code and building AI applications from scratch*. My goal is to provide deep understanding of core theories and inner workings — so you truly *feel how it works*.

All code is open-source, and I walk you through everything on *my YouTube channel* 👉 [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/@TharakaKodithuwakku06) in *Sinhala/English*.
